This ciphertext has been XOR encrypted with key of unknown length. <br> <br>
For instance, if the key was `wot`, the first byte of the plaintext would be XORed with `w`, the second with `o`, the third with `t`, and then it would loop around to XOR the fourth character with `w` <br> <br>
The cipher text is also in Base64, which you'll need to decode before XORing
